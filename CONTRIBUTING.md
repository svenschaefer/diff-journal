# Contributing

diff-journal is intentionally small and focused.

Before opening an issue or pull request:
- please read the README carefully
- ensure the change aligns with the core guarantees:
  - append-only semantics
  - deterministic replay
  - auditability

Large refactorings, feature expansions, or API redesigns
will likely be rejected to preserve the core model.

Small, well-scoped improvements are welcome.
